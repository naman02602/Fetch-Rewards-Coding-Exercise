### Few Points to Note:
- ER Model has been developed on dream.io and SQL Query solutions have been written in MS SQL Server.
- The Brands and Receipt data seems not to connect however, it should ideally be connecting eiether directly through barcode or indirectly by introducing a table for product items.
- In the current dataset, barcode or brandcode seems to be the only columns that may have potential to connect with receipts item data, but misses the connection due to inconsistent information in receipts item data.
- The jupyter notebook contains the data quality evaluation perfromed on a basic level. We can dig lot more deeper to identify data quality issues.
